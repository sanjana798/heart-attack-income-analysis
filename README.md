Heart Attack Risk vs. Income Analysis in California

Project Overview

This project investigates the relationship between income levels and heart attack risk in California. Using publicly available datasets, the analysis explores socioeconomic factors contributing to cardiovascular health outcomes and identifies patterns that may inform public health decisions.


My Role / Contributions
Collected, cleaned, and preprocessed the dataset for analysis
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations
Tested multiple statistical and predictive models to examine relationships between income and heart attack risk
Generated actionable insights and visualizations to summarize findings
Presented results in a final report / notebook


Tools Used
Python
Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation
Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and visualization
Matplotlib / Seaborn for plotting


Key Insights / Outcomes
Observed clear correlations between income and heart attack prevalence in certain demographics
Identified socioeconomic patterns that could inform health interventions
Practiced end-to-end data analysis workflow: data collection → cleaning → modeling → interpretation → presentation
